# Optic Lobe Connectome

This repository is a collection of code for analyzing the optic lobe in the new Male Brain dataset ([Janelia FlyEM](https://neuprint-cns.janelia.org/?dataset=cns&qt=findneurons)). At this point it is only intended for internal use -- if you can see the repository, the [Reiser lab](https://www.janelia.org/lab/reiser-lab/) has invited you to contribute to the effort.

## Infrastructure

To allow others in the team to replicate the analysis, the code should be human-readable and run on several systems. 

### Set up a Python environment

In the guide on [getting started in Python](docs/python-getting-started.md), I provide a step-by-step documentation on how to set up a working environment and run you through a first analysis.
