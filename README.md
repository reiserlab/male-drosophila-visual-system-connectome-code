# Optic Lobe Connectome

This repository is a collection of code for analyzing the optic lobe in the new Male Brain dataset ([Janelia FlyEM](https://neuprint.janelia.org/?dataset=optic-lobe:v1.0&qt=findneurons)). You can find the preprint at [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.16.589741).

Please also visit our [Cell Type Explorer](https://reiserlab.github.io/male-drosophila-visual-system-connectome/) where we describe each of the more than 700 cell types with their neuropil innervation, some descriptive statistics regarding coverage in Medulla, Lobula, and Lobula Plate as well as the upstream and downstream connecting partners. Finally, get an impression of the cell type morphology on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ReiserLab).

All resources, including direct contacts to the authors, are nicely bundled in our Janelia landing page ["Seeing is believing: Janelia reveals connectome of the fruit fly visual system"](https://www.janelia.org/news/seeing-is-believing-janelia-reveals-connectome-of-the-fruit-fly-visual-system).

# Get started

To allow others in the team to replicate the analysis, the code should be human-readable and run on several systems. 

In the guide on [getting started in Python](docs/python-getting-started.md), we provide a step-by-step documentation on how to set up a working environment and run you through a first example.
