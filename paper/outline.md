title: Structure for OL paper
comment: Rough outline developed during lab meeting on 11/1/22
---

# general introduction

- how many cell types
- what are regions
- how much in each region
- how many cell bodies
- summary quantification
- columns, repeating cells, "short paragraph" of EyeMap
- does morphology matter in function (link to modeling questions of [Janne])


# cell types (8 figures)

- observations on any level [Aljoscha]
- connections between cell types
- summarizing cell types
- morphological details [tables]
  - axon sizes,
  - number of synapses
- anatomy centric paper style
- general grouping based on
  - input,
  - names,
  - pseudo-functional (connectivity)
- regional specialization pattern (eg VPN)
- Figure: OL intrinsic types
 summarization

# Function (10 fiures)

- color
- motion
- regions
- more speculative
- looking for assymetries
- list of types of analysis

# Modules (2 figures)

- connectivity
- cellular
  - axon width,
  - number of synapses,
  - types of synapses
- clustering / modules [Judith]
- pathways (motifs)
- specialized groups
  - detailed EyeMap?
  - dorsal rim related,
  - accessory medula,
  - color
  - clock neurons
- spatial
  - offset analysis,
  - receptive field,
  - equator only pattern
- variability analysis
  - [Hopkins?]
  - more rudimentary 80/20 comparison
- connectivity summary


# Summary

- Input / Output analysis
- x% is visual
  - y% is motion…
  - z% is color…
- revisit general themes

# Not included

- detailed connectivity analysis (but include a small summary)
- Flywire comparison?
