# Figure Plan / budget

1. Data set overview. Basic OL anatomy. Cell type survey (optional). (2 Figs)
2. Repetitive structure w. columnar neurons (Mi1 + ~14 others), sorting across neuropils (Kit’s curation) (2 Figs)
3. Eye map w. equator (1 Fig)
4. Columns and layers, traditional layers, our method for ROIs (3-4 Figs)
5. Cell type sorting: illustrate w. examples for morphology/connectivity splitting, then spatial sorting, then
clustering. Explain p/y designation (5 Figs)
6. Neurotransmitter predictions, new FISH data for ~50 cell types (per cell, per type consistency). Summary of
NTs by cell groups.(2-3 Figs + several supp)
7. The inventory of all cells (20-40 Figs; ~100 supplemental Figs — primarily views) Movies could replace
many supplemental figures. Should discuss on Thursday.
8. DRA (1 Fig) / AMe cells (1 Fig) / margins vs. bulk (1 Fig)
9. split-GAL4 line collections w. FlipOuts, matching cells etc. (2 Figs)
10. spatial coverage (% of columns by cell type); overlap / tiling (2-5 Figs) - Laura volunteered
11. Summary data - by neuropil I/O, by cell type (2 Figs)

## Notes

- LM images sprinkled throughout other figures
- many data tables, list to be made soon

## suggestion

- rough placeholders for most figures ASAP
- as google slides (MR starts next week)
