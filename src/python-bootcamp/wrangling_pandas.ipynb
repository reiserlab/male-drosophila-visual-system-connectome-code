    "[Pandas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)) is a Python library that provides data structures for manipulating tables (think spreadsheet or database tables for Python). It is built on top of another library [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy), a library introducing arrays and matrices to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas offers two main data types: [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#series), a one-dimensional array for any Python data type and [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe), a two-dimensional structure of several Series. DataFrames are heavily inspired and very similar to the R [data.frame](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/data.frame) or the tidyverse [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern Python libraries ([plotting](https://matplotlib.org/), [machine learning](https://scikit-learn.org/), other [scientific libraries](https://scipy.org/)) are compatible with pandas. Pandas are [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen) in [neuprint-python](https://github.com/connectome-neuprint/neuprint-python). Below I show how to navigate pandas DataFrames and some basic operations."

    "The DataFrame is a table with rows and columns. The rows are addressed by the `index`, which is a key to access rows. The `neuprint.fetch_neuron()` function adds a counter to the table, which starts a 0 for the first row and increases by 1 for each row. The properties `df.index` and `df.columns` expose more information about the _row names_ and _columns names_ of the DataFrame.\n",

For example, `df.loc[0:2, 'bodyId':'type']` gives you a DataFrame with the index including 0 and 2 (in this case the first three rows), and the columns including 'bodyId' and 'type' (the first three columns). Either row or column parameter can be a single value, a range by specifying start __COLON__ end, an array (eg `['bodyId', 'instance', 'type']`), or everything (wildcard) by writing just a __COLON__. For example, `df.loc[:,'bodyId']` would return all values from the 'bodyId' column. _Note_: Since the index and columns names refer to the discrete the start and end values are included in the selection, which is different from most other Python functions that use ranges.\n",

    "Instead of the index or column names, `df.iloc` uses the location in the table. To get the first 3 rows and columns, the corresponding code would be `df.iloc[0:3, 0,3]`. This is similar to most other Python functions using ranges and is easier to remember if you think as the x- and y-indices of the tables as continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "When `neuprint.fetch_neuron()` returns a DataFrame, the index is an increment starting at 0. There is no guaranteed order in which the neurons are returned (although in most cases it is sorted by `bodyId`). Therefore the number used in the index is meaningless outside the fetch function. Instead, it might be better to use the `bodyId` as an index. You can define a column as the index through `df.set_index()` (and return to an increment as index via `df.reset_index()`). In theory, indices don't have to be unique – for example you could define the column `type` as an index – but that will create issues if you use the index to access rows. Since the `bodyId` is unique, this shouldn't be an issue. Using the `bodyId` as an index in this particular DataFrame also gives us a list of neurons whenever we do conditional selections. For example, the output of the comparison for `neuron_bodyid_df` below is immediately useful -- you could, for example, copy&paste a `bodyId` for a `True` value to [neuprint](https://neuprint-cns.janelia.org) to look at an L1 neuron."
