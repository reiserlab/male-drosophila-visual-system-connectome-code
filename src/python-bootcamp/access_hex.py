# ## Find bodyIDs for a hex
#
# `hex_to_bids()` gets all the cells that are assigned to a specific column. Define the column using
# a tuple. By default the function returns the body ids for all 12 cell types, but `n_types` can
# provide a list of cell types that the function should return.
#
# The function returns a dictionary with the cell types as keys and the body ids as a list of values.
# In most cases each key will have a list with a single item.
#
# The dictionary will not contain keys for cell types that are note represented in the column.

# ## Get the whole DataFrame
#
# This function gives you the whole DataFrame in the raw format. You will need to ask @kitlongden about
# the exact definition, what duplicate hex IDs and `NaN` means, and why the data frame has more rows
# than we have columns in the eye. So use at your own risk.

# ## List of columns that are missing cell types

# present.

# %% [markdown]
# ## List columns with duplicates
#
# This function returns a list of tuples with hex IDs for columns where more at least one cell type
