# Python bootcamp

This folder is for some basic scripts with a focus of understanding Python, not so much the biology.

1. `wrangling_pandas.ipynb`: simple data manipulation in pandas.
2. `show_one_neuron.ipynb`: pull a neuron from neuprint and have a 3D navigatable figure in a Jupyter notebook.
3. `plot_3D.ipynb`: demonstrate the different plottig libaries (in this project we'll use plotly).
4. `ol_colors_example.ipynb`: how to use the color palette for this project.
5. `access_hex.ipynb`: helper functions to convert between hex location and body ID.
6. `query_bags.ipynb`: helper object to work with groups of neurons.
7. `geometry_eg.ipynb`: demonstrate projections and geometries.
8. `plot_sliced_cells.ipynb`: plotting groups of neurons.
