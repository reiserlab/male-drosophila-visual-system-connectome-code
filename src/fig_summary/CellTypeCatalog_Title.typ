= Summary of the anatomy and connectivity of all visual system neurons

The 68-page summary of all the neurons follows the conventions of Fig. 5. The quantified morphology and distribution of pre- and post-synapses, together with the top five connected cells, are found on odd pages. Some bilateral neurons are found in the right optic lobe, and to distinguish between the right and left hemisphere versions of the cell type, we treat them separately and append an (R) or (L) to the cell typeâ€™s name. In the top 5 connectivity data in the center panel, left-hemisphere cell types are indicated with a magenta label.

A gallery of rendered example neurons is paired with the summary data and shown on even pages. A representative neuron of each type has been selected and is shown in a sliced view to reveal the innervation patterns of the visual regions. Each slice is taken from one of three locations, indicated by D (dorsal), E (equatorial), or V (ventral), with most neurons shown in the E slice, except for cases where the cells are best captured in the other locations. We note that the layers are sheared relative to the slicing planes in the D and V locations, so the layer patterns are provided as suggestions, but the more accurate description is found in the accompanying data plots.
