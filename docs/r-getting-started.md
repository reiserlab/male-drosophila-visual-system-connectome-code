# Getting started in R

Download and install R either from the [R-project website](https://www.r-project.org/) or as part of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment.

Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), an extremely helpful IDE for R code. You could develop R without it but you really don't want to :-)

Once you start the RStudio, open the R example file from [src/completeness/connection-completeness_named.Rmd](../src/completeness/connection-completeness_named.Rmd). You should be able to run it now. The first time you run the code, it will install some additional libraries.
