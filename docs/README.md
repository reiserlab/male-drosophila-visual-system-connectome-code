# Documentation

This folder contains the internal documentation for the Optic Lobe Connectome project.

## Getting started

On 2/14/2022 we will be running an install party during lab meeting. The goal for this session is, that everyone opens a pull request from their own branch. This branch should contain two suggested changes to the main branch: 

1. a xlsx file in `results/completeness`, which is produced when you run the `src/completeness/connection-completeness_named.*` notebook
2. your name in the [`/CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

There are a number of documents that help you to get started. I suggest the following reading order:

1. [Getting started with Python](python-getting-started.md). At one point you will need to download the project from GitHub, so the [Cloning section in the git guide](git-getting-started.md#cloning) might be helpful.
2. [Getting started with Python editors](python-editors-getting-started.md) will have some information on how to edit Python files and might come in handy once you have a working Python environment.
3. [Getting started with git](git-getting-started.md) will finally run through some basic git terminology and the workflow I suggest for this project.

## Next steps

If you are done with the above, you could work on the following:

- do some other analysis on the data
- generate some plots
- write a best practice document for plots
- write a best practice document for Python code
- create the same analysis in R
- write a _Getting Started in R_ guide
